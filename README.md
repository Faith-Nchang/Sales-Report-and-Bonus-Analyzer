# Sales-Report-and-Bonus-Analyzer
Computes the sales made by each store from each category, and the bonuses each store's staff will receive based on the sales

Minnie and Mickey are getting ready to send out Holiday bonuses to their hard-working employees in Retail District #5. The bonuses are calculated based on how much each retail store sold in each category. The retail store with the highest amount sold in the category will receive $5,000. The retail store with the lowest amount sold in a category will receive $1,000. All other retail stores in district #5 will receive $2,000. If a retail store didn’t sale anything in a category, or they have a negative sales amount, they are not eligible for a bonus in that category. If only one retail store sold items in a category, they are eligible to receive only the bonus of $5000 for that category.

Create a utility class that manipulates a two-dimensional ragged array of doubles. This utility class will be used to create a Sales Report for Retail District #5. It will accommodate positive and negative numbers. Follow the Javadoc provided. 
Create a utility class that will calculate holiday bonuses given a ragged array of doubles which represent the sales for each store in each category. It will also take in bonus amount for the store with the highest sales in a category, the bonus amount for the store with the lowest sales in a category and the bonus amount for all other stores.
These utility classes will be used with an existing GUI class to create a sales report and display holiday bonuses.
